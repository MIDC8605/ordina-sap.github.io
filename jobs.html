        <p>
           The SAP unit at Ordina is a frontrunner in the area of SAP innovation. We focus on exiting areas like S4/HANA implementation and SAP Leonardo.
           We already have a nice track record in the IoT world and have a lot of experience with SAP Cloud Platform. But of course we also excel in more 
           classic SAP skills like NetWeaver, WebdynPro, Portal and so on.
           On a functional level we have a focus on CRM, Logistics and Utilities.
            We're very fond of our <span class="accentuate">down-to-earth culture</span> and no-bullshit way of working.
        </p>
