<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Angular is ideal for building complete applications, and our tooling, documentation and infrastructure are primarily aimed at this case.
But it's quite challenging to use in scenarios that don't fit that specific Single Page Application model.
</p></blockquote>

Other use-cases where Angular is not (currently) an ideal choice are:

* **Reusability** - Reuse components across teams and projects
* **CMS Pages** - Embed standalone apps in CMS powered websites
* **Widgets** - Use Angular components in other environments

#### Solutions

In come Web Components: an umbrella-term covering four definitions of specifications trying to tackle these problems:

* Templates in HTML, declared with the &lt;template&gt;-tag and instantiated later.
* HTML being imported, which is actually mostly abandoned by major browsers.
* A Shadow DOM for DOM and Style encapsulation.
* Custom Elements that can extend the browser's vocabulary.

When talking about Web Components, it can be about one of these definitions or a combination of any of these.
Focusing on the last specification, Custom Elements.

For example, a Custom Element has a custom tag (e.g.: &lt;my-custom-element&gt;&lt;/my-custom-element&gt;).
They share the same API as native elements, with attributes, properties, methods and events.
A Custom Element also has 'Reactions', callbacks for when the element is created and loaded/un-loaded or an attribute changes.
A custom element tag is regarded as a HTMLUnknownElement until it is registered as a Custom Element.

An example of a custom element:

```javascript
class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
  ...
  // Attributes
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['mode'];
  }
  ...
  // Properties
  get mode() {
    return this.getAttribute('mode');
  }

  set mode(val) {
    this.setAttribute('mode', val);
  }
  ...
  // Events
  emitModeChange() {
    let modeChangeEvent = new CustomEvent('mode-change', {
      detail: this.mode
    });
    this.dispatchEvent(modeChangeEvent);
  }
  ...
  // Reactions
  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
    if (name === 'mode') {
      // do something with newValue
    }
  }
  ...
}
// Register the element
customElements.define('my-custom-element', MyCustomElement);
```

#### You said Angular?

These sound a lot like Angular Components, and that is where Angular Elements tries to combine these two technologies.
Custom Elements share a lot of similarities with an Angular Component.

* @HostBinding() ‚Üí Attributes
* @Input() ‚Üí Properties
* @Output() ‚Üí CustomEvent()
* Lifecycle Hooks ‚Üí Reactions

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Angular Components packaged as Custom Elements.*</p>

<p><em>* kinda like Custom Elements on steroids; designed to work outside Angular apps</em>
</p></blockquote>

Using Angular Elements, it's possible to convert a Component into a Custom Element and register it.
This creates an element that is an Angular Component on the inside, but using standards on the outside.

#### Conclusion

Angular Elements makes your components usable everywhere.
It might become standalone component model for Angular.
But it's not ready yet as some things still need to be figured out (packaging, dependency management etc.)

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Most static websites and blogs are designed using generators like Jekyll or Hugo. But why would you, as an Angular Developer, use those generators? 
Angular makes it perfectly possible to build a fast, static website using Angular Universal.
</p></blockquote>

#### Angular for a static website?

Yes, you can use Angular for building a static website. When using Angular it is possible to create components which can be re-used anywhere on the website.
You could for example create a blogpost component which reads out data from a JSON file containing a list of blogposts. No more copy-pasting a lot of HTML.

You can get started by generating a new Angular application with the CLI. But we're going to do it from scratch.
By doing this we can learn how Angular applications are wired and we're able to use new tools, like FuseBox.

### Let's Start

```bash
yarn init -y
```

Install angular packages, rxjs, typescript, core-js, zone.js:
```bash
yarn add core-js zone.js rxjs @angular/animations @angular/common @angular/compiler @angular/core @angular/http @angular/platform-browser @angular/platform-browser-dynamic @angular/platform-server
yarn add -D typescript
```

So we create **the app skeleton** by creating an *index.html*, the *AppModule and AppComponent*.
We also create a main.ts to bootstrap the Module.

Next we setup the build by creating a *tsconfig.json* and running *tsc*.

#### Meet FuseBox

Once done, you will need to bundle all the code to make it available as HTML files which can be deployed to Github Pages or Firebase Hosting.
The Angular CLI's default bundling solution is Webpack, but another great alternative is [FuseBox](https://fuse-box.org). 

FuseBox has three major benefits:
- It is super duper fast.
- It has built-in TypeScript support.
- It has a powerful, yet simple configuration.

Let's install FuseBox with the following command: 
```bash
yarn add -D fuse-box
```

The only thing we have to do next is creating a file called `fuse.js` which is self explanatory:

```javascript
const { FuseBox } = require('fuse-box');

const fuse = FuseBox.init({
    homeDir : 'src',
    output : 'dist/$name.js'
})

fuse.dev(); // launch http server with live reloading

fuse.bundle('app').instructions(' > main.ts').hmr().watch(); 

fuse.run();
```

And run `node fuse` to see FuseBox in action (be warned, it's very fast). All the code is bundled and can be served. 
But you might have noticed that it loads slow, especially with a 3G connection. This can be fixed with Angular Universal.

#### Angular Universal for rendering pages at-build time

A regular Angular application executes in the browser, rendering pages in the DOM in response to user actions. This might take a while.
But for a simple website or blog you want the content to show immediately. This is were Angular Universal comes in action.

Angular Universal generates static application pages on the server via **server-side rendering (SSR)**.
The pages are pure HTML, and can display even if JavaScript is disabled. The user is shown the HTML and in the background the Angular app is loading.
Once the scripts are loaded, all Angular powers become available.

To setup Angular Universal you have to create a `NgModule` called `AppServerModule` where you import `AppModule` and bootstrap `AppComponent`:

```javascript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { ServerModule } from '@angular/platform-server';

import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [ AppModule, ServerModule ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
})
export class AppServerModule {}
```

You also have to update the `BrowserModule` import in `AppModule` to indicate that we are transitioning from a server-rendered app.

```javascript
  ...
  imports: [
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'a-random-app-id' }),
    ...
```


To run Angular Universal you simply run a build script with `ts-node build.ts`. 
The script below places all the rendered application content in the `index.html` file in the dist folder.

```javascript
import 'zone.js/dist/zone-node';
import 'core.js/es7/reflect';

import { renderModule } from '@angular/platform-server';
import { AppServerModule } from './src/app/app-server.module';
import * as fs from 'fs';

renderModule(AppServerModule, {
    document: fs.readFileSync('src/index.html').toString()
}).then(result => {
    fs.writeFileSync('dist/index.html', result);
})
```

#### Conclusion

Angular Universal together with FuseBox can be used for building fast static websites such as a blog or a landing page.

### Manfred Steyer: A close look at Angular's new HttpClient

<span class="image left small"><img class="p-image" alt="Manfred Steyer" src="/img/ng-be-2017/speaker-manfred-steyer.jpg"></span>

Manfred Steyer is a Google Developer Export who writes for O'Reilly, Hanser, windows.developer and Heise Developer. He regularly speaks at conferences.

You can find Manfred on Twitter using the handle [@ManfredSteyer](https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer).

The slides of his presentation can be found on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/manfredsteyer/a-close-look-to-angulars-new-httpclient).
The demo of his presentation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/http-client-demo)

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Angular 2 came with the Http service, but it was experimental all the time. That's why, since version 5.0, it's deprecated
in favour of the new HttpClient. 
</p></blockquote> 

The new HttpClient got introduced in Angular 4.3 and is based on the good old `$http` service from AngularJS. 
It rests on the `XMLHttpRequest` interface which is exposed by all browsers and is the way to go if you have to communicate with HTTP-based API's.

It is mainly used to get/post JSON data but there are other possibilities too. A perfect example are files, who can be handled by binary streams.

#### Dealing with binary streams

With the new HttpClient, handling binary streams is a piece of cake. Downloading a file can be done with just two lines of code. 
The response type in this example is a binary large object (blob) which is supported by all the browsers nowadays.

```javascript
downloadFile(id: number): Observable<any> {
    let url = `${this.baseUrl}/picture/hotels/${id}`;
    return this.http.get(url, { responseType: 'blob' });
}
```

Uploading a file can also be done with two lines of code. This method uses the `File` object from the browser.
When specifying `reportProgress: true`, the request exposes progress events which can be monitored and are useful for showing progress bars during an upload.

```javascript
uploadFile(id: number, file: File): Observable<HttpEvent<object>> {
    let url = `${this.baseUrl}/picture/hotels/${id}`;
    return this
            .http
            .put(url, file, {reportProgress: true, observe: 'events'});
}
``` 

To show a progress bar during an upload you can subscribe to the method above and handle the `HttpEvent`. 
If the event's type is `UploadProgress`, you can update for example a `percentDone` number.

```javascript
handleHttpEvent(event: HttpEvent<object>) {
    if (event.type === HttpEventType.UploadProgress) {
        this.percentDone = Math.round(event.loaded / event.total * 100);
    } else if (event instanceof HttpResponse) {
        this.percentDone = 100;
        console.debug('response', event);
    }
} 
```

#### Interceptors

With interceptors it is possible to intercept a `HttpRequest` and transform the request before passing it through.
This is mainly used to define a global handling for requests regarding security or error handling. Define it once, and it will be used for every request in your project.

Within Angular you have to implement the `HttpInterceptor` interface and you're ready to transform the request. 

Take a look at the example below where every request that starts with a given URL is intercepted and is given an authorization token.
This is actually considered **a security best practice**!

```javascript
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
    ...
    public intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
        let url = req.url.toLowerCase();
    
        if (url.startsWith(this.baseUrl)) {
            let token = this.authStorage.getItem('access_token');
            let header = 'Bearer ' + token;
            let headers = req.headers.set('Authorization', header);
    
            req = req.clone({ headers });
        }
    
        return next.handle(req).pipe(
            map(event => event),
            catchError(err => this.handleError(err))
        )
    }
    
    handleError(error: HttpErrorResponse) {
        if (error.status === 401 || error.status === 403) {
            this.router.navigate(['/home', {needsLogin: true}]);
            return of(null);
        }
        return of(error); 
    }
}
```

Now every request to the given URL will contain an authorization token. The code above also provides a global error handling. 
In this case, when the server responds with a HTTP 401 or 403, the user is redirected to the homepage and a login is required.

To make this interceptor available for the application it has to be added as a provider to the `AppModule`.

```javascript
@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [
    { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true },
  ],
  ...
})
export class AppModule { }
``` 

And that's how you can use interceptors.

#### Conclusion
These were some good examples on how to implement the HttpClient in an Angular application. 
Angular has a [great tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6) on how to get started with the HttpClient.
Also make sure to check out **[angular-crud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-crud)**, a side-project of Manfred.
It is great for generating an Angular CRUD application and saves some precious time. 

And remember... The Dark Knight is the best movie ever.
