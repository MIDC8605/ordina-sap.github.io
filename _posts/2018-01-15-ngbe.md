### Pascal Precht: Angular Elements

Pascal Precht is co-founder of [@thoughtram](http://thoughtram.io) and [MachineLabs](https://machinelabs.ai), but also a Google Developer Expert for the Angular team.

You can find The Mighty Parrot üê¶ on Twitter using the handle [@PascalPrecht](https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht).

The slides and a demo of his presentation can be found on [pascalprecht.github.io](http://pascalprecht.github.io/slides/angular-elements).

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Angular is ideal for building complete applications, and our tooling, documentation and infrastructure are primarily aimed at this case.
But it's quite challenging to use in scenarios that don't fit that specific Single Page Application model.
</p></blockquote>

Other use-cases where Angular is not (currently) an ideal choice are:

* **Reusability** - Reuse components across teams and projects
* **CMS Pages** - Embed standalone apps in CMS powered websites
* **Widgets** - Use Angular components in other environments

#### Solutions

In come Web Components: an umbrella-term covering four definitions of specifications trying to tackle these problems:

* Templates in HTML, declared with the &lt;template&gt;-tag and instantiated later.
* HTML being imported, which is actually mostly abandoned by major browsers.
* A Shadow DOM for DOM and Style encapsulation.
* Custom Elements that can extend the browser's vocabulary.

When talking about Web Components, it can be about one of these definitions or a combination of any of these.
Focusing on the last specification, Custom Elements.

For example, a Custom Element has a custom tag (e.g.: &lt;my-custom-element&gt;&lt;/my-custom-element&gt;).
They share the same API as native elements, with attributes, properties, methods and events.
A Custom Element also has 'Reactions', callbacks for when the element is created and loaded/un-loaded or an attribute changes.
A custom element tag is regarded as a HTMLUnknownElement until it is registered as a Custom Element.

An example of a custom element:

```javascript
class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
  ...
  // Attributes
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['mode'];
  }
  ...
  // Properties
  get mode() {
    return this.getAttribute('mode');
  }

  set mode(val) {
    this.setAttribute('mode', val);
  }
  ...
  // Events
  emitModeChange() {
    let modeChangeEvent = new CustomEvent('mode-change', {
      detail: this.mode
    });
    this.dispatchEvent(modeChangeEvent);
  }
  ...
  // Reactions
  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
    if (name === 'mode') {
      // do something with newValue
    }
  }
  ...
}
// Register the element
customElements.define('my-custom-element', MyCustomElement);
```

#### You said Angular?

These sound a lot like Angular Components, and that is where Angular Elements tries to combine these two technologies.
Custom Elements share a lot of similarities with an Angular Component.

* @HostBinding() ‚Üí Attributes
* @Input() ‚Üí Properties
* @Output() ‚Üí CustomEvent()
* Lifecycle Hooks ‚Üí Reactions

<blockquote class="clear"><p>
Angular Components packaged as Custom Elements.*</p>

<p><em>* kinda like Custom Elements on steroids; designed to work outside Angular apps</em>
</p></blockquote>

Using Angular Elements, it's possible to convert a Component into a Custom Element and register it.
This creates an element that is an Angular Component on the inside, but using standards on the outside.

#### Conclusion

Angular Elements makes your components usable everywhere.
It might become standalone component model for Angular.
But it's not ready yet as some things still need to be figured out (packaging, dependency management etc.)
