            <p>
              As a SAP IoT consultant, you will be collaborating with startups,
              corporates and government agencies in order to develop projects
              and platforms to help create new IoT data marketplaces and
              innovation testbeds, lowering existing barriers for sharing of
              IoT data among organizations. Together with your engagement team
              you develop complex analytical solutions that meet the needs of
              the client in new, innovative ways. You quickly adopt emerging
              technological trends (such as predictive analytics, business
              analytics, or machine learning) to develop creative solutions.
              You support business requirements and learn to identify them,
              you conduct value discovery tracks, develop functional and
              technical design documents, prototypes and test solutions,
              train users, and define support procedures. You develop
              ‘thought ware’ and ‘point-of-view’ documents related to the
              Internet of Things.</p>
