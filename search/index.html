        "content": "Unit testing for ABAP 101 and why you should do itAs a developer, you can spend quite a lot of time validating your work. This can mean that you run through your developments step by step, by F5’ing your way through an entire new business process. While this method provides added value in small scenario’s, this still requires your invested attention and errors can still take place. You’re only human after all.In today’s world, SAP applications need to be developed and changed at a faster pace. All the while, continuance also needs to be guaranteed. More and more SAP projects also follow an agile flow and DevOps is a more common feature in many organizations. This way of working requires an adjustment in the way developers handle their work.Table of contents  Unit what?  How to implement  Benefits and drawbacks  SummaryUnit what?ABAP unit is an SAP testing tool that enables the ABAP developer to test individual blocks of a process. This can also be automated, to provide a backbone in bigger systems and ensure continued successful processes. Unit tests are defined and implemented as local classes inside a main program. It can be defined for a class, function pool, executable program, or module pool. We will focus on the implementation for class-based programming. A test is organized into classes which contain test methods. Small units are tested within the setup. The purpose of a test method is to check if a certain block in logic returns the desired result. The service class CL_ABAP_UNIT_ASSERT contains methods that can compare actual values that are calculated in the logic with the expected value you provide in the test. When you run a unit test, the results are described in the ABAP Unit result display screen. Here you can see which test methods have failed or succeeded and what the calculated values were. How to implementNow, let’s try to implement a simple unit test for a class. We’ll work with a simple class that simulates a scoreboard. The score can be gained or lost.---CLASS ycl_test_scoreboard DEFINITION  PUBLIC  FINAL  CREATE PUBLIC .  PUBLIC SECTION.    DATA: mv_score TYPE i.    METHODS: add_score IMPORTING iv_score TYPE i iv_type TYPE string.  PROTECTED SECTION.  PRIVATE SECTION.ENDCLASS.The implementation of the method could look like this:---CLASS ycl_test_scoreboard IMPLEMENTATION.    METHOD add_score.        mv_score = SWITCH #( iv_type                        WHEN 'win'  THEN mv_score + iv_score                        WHEN 'loss' THEN mv_score - iv_score                        ELSE 0 ).    ENDMETHOD.ENDCLASS.Now, let’s get started with our unit tests. Before I start implementing, I like to first determine the scenarios I want to test. For this example, I immediately recognize 3 situations.  Does the addition of a score work?  Does the loss of some score points work?  Furthermore, I’d like to test the result for trying to give an unrecognized type for adding a score.For this tutorial, I’m working in Eclipse. At the bottom of the class editor, there’s a ribbon from which you can navigate to the editor for test classes.If you feel more comfortable working in the SAP GUI, you can locate the button at the top right of the screen in SE24:We start by defining the test class, as we would for a regular class. The definition does look a bit different though.PRO TIP: If you’re working in Eclipse, there is a handy template to generate the basic definition of a test class. Just type ‘testclass’ and trigger the auto-complete.In the public section, define the methods that will execute the tests. Also define an instance of the class you’re testing. This instance will call the method that contains the logic you want to test. How the definition could be written:CLASS lcl_ DEFINITION FINAL FOR TESTING  DURATION SHORT  RISK LEVEL HARMLESS.  PRIVATE SECTION.    METHODS:      setup,      teardown,      score_test_win     FOR TESTING,      score_test_loss    FOR TESTING,      score_test_unknown FOR TESTING.    DATA: mo_cut TYPE REF TO ycl_test_scoreboard.ENDCLASS.Notice that we also have a ‘setup’ and ‘teardown’ method. These are predefined methods in ABAP unit and are respectively called before and after each test method in the test class. In setup( ) you can setup your test data which can be leveraged by various different test within the same test class. In our example, we instantiate the object for our scoreboard class and setup a default value for the score attribute.In teardown( ) you can clear the test data that is used in the test. It is common practice to use this method to clear objects and attributes and make a clean slate for the next test method.The implementation of the test class could look like this:CLASS lcl_ IMPLEMENTATION.  METHOD setup.    mo_cut = NEW #( ).    mo_cut-&gt;mv_score = 50.  ENDMETHOD.  METHOD teardown.    CLEAR mo_cut.  ENDMETHOD.  METHOD score_test_win.    mo_cut-&gt;add_score( iv_score = 25 iv_type = |win| ).    cl_abap_unit_assert=&gt;assert_equals( act = mo_cut-&gt;mv_score exp = 75 ).  ENDMETHOD.  METHOD score_test_loss.    mo_cut-&gt;add_score( iv_score = 25 iv_type = |loss| ).    cl_abap_unit_assert=&gt;assert_equals( act = mo_cut-&gt;mv_score exp = 25 ).  ENDMETHOD.  METHOD score_test_unknown.    mo_cut-&gt;add_score( iv_score = 25 iv_type = |kick| ).    cl_abap_unit_assert=&gt;assert_equals( act = mo_cut-&gt;mv_score exp = 50 ).  ENDMETHOD.ENDCLASS.Now let’s execute a test run. Go to the class in Eclipse and retrieve the context menu:There’s a result window that displays the number of test methods that were executed and the result of each test. In our case, all methods were successful.If we change an expected value, the method will fail and the result will also be shown in the ABAP Unit Runner overview. METHOD score_test_unknown.    mo_cut-&gt;add_score( iv_score = 25 iv_type = |kick| ).    cl_abap_unit_assert=&gt;assert_equals( act = mo_cut-&gt;mv_score exp = 50 ). ENDMETHOD.This would fail as the logic we implemented in our scoreboard class would return zero for an unknown type of score. The overview displays which method failed, what the actual value is, and at what line the code went wrong.Benefits and drawbacksA huge benefit that I have personally experienced, is that a process logic remains tested during refactoring. As a consultant, you’re often placed in an environment with existing code. You don’t always get the luxury of creating new stuff from scratch. When an existing solution needs to be adjusted, I find It’s very helpful if it’s been unit tested. This helps to ensure continuation of existing processes.It can also be that through upgrades, new syntax and processing capabilities are introduced that you might want to use in certain developments. Here it can be useful if you’ve written some unit tests to aid the refactoring process.When you’re writing unit tests, it can sometimes be difficult to find all the scenario’s you want to test. In a big process, it’s not always easy to compartmentalize logic into smaller blocks for unit tests. Another drawback is that the performance or quality of a unit test is directly dependent on the developer responsible for writing it.SummaryABAP unit is a testing tool that provides developers the opportunity to test their code. Unit tests are defined and implemented as local classes inside a main program and can be used for a class, function pool, executable program, or module pool. Test methods are used to check if a certain part of the process returns the desired result.Unit tests are easy to implement. It helps developers to distinguish capabilities of existing code and aids them in refactoring operations. The determination of scenario’s can be a challenge and the quality of the tests depends on the covered scenario’s. It’s the developer’s responsibility to provide a good test which covers the most relevant process outcomes."

        "content": "Deploying your Fiori apps and Fiori Launchpad on SAP Cloud FoundryBuilding and deploying Fiori apps and installing SAP Portal is easy on the SAP Cloud Platform NEO environment. Since everything is automated and done for you.On the SAP Cloud Foundry environment things quickly get a bit more technical. SAP may, or may not improve this in the future by hiding away the technical details. Personally, I like the more technical aspect of CloudFoundry vs NEO. The fact that you know more in detail about what is going on gives you more to work with when something goes wrong. In this article, I’m going to explain how I deployed a couple of SAPUI5 apps on CloudFoundry, configured Portal to use them, and added destinations and security for the whole thing to work.Table of contents  What do you need?  Create a manifest  Configure and deploy PortalWhat do you need?  A text editor of your choice (I really like Visual Studio Code)  The CloudFoundry CLI  Some kind of SAPUI5 application you want to deploy  SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry account, this can be a trial or productive accountCreate a manifestIf you have experience with developping SAPUI5 apps, you are probably familiar with the neo-app.json file. This basically tells the NEO HTML5 service what to do with authentication, destinations, where to find the index file… The container we are going to create is not aware of this file and will ignore it. This means that we have to handle everything in the neo-app.json in some other way. The first step is the manifest.yaml. The manifest that we are going to create is not to be confused with the existing manifest.json, which is used by the SAPUI5 bootstrapping process.manifest.yaml has to be created in the root of your project directory. It tells CloudFoundry what kind of buildpack to use, the name, memory limit, host and how to start the application.Since a SAPUI5 app is nothing more than a collection of HTML, CSS and JS files to be served, we can use a simple webserver like nginx to host our files.This is a working example of a manifest of one of my apps:---applications:- name: YourApp  path: dist  memory: 256MB  instances: 1  buildpack: nodejs_buildpack  command: node app.js  host: yourappOf course this app can run on less memory, as little as 64mb.Build &amp; DeployIt could be handy to deploy the app already, but we will need to change the datasource later on.Build the project by right-clicking it and clicking Build &gt; Build Project. You can also run Grunt if you are working with a directory on your local filesystem.Clone the git repository locally, or download the project as a zip file from the WebIDE and unpack on your local drive.Deploy using cf push when in a command shell in the root of the project folder.When the deploy succeeds, note down the app url, we will need it later on.Configure and deploy PortalActivate PortalFirst, activate the service in your NEO account, if not already done. Then, you need to create a new Fiori Launchpad site. When you are in the site admin page, note down, or copy the subdomain. Eg. https://flpnwc-xxxxxxx.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/sites/adminspace#siteDirectory-showCreate the siteNext, go to your space in the CloudFoundry account where you want to deploy the Portal site.Click ‘Portal’ on the left navigation menu, and then the ‘New Site’ button. Fill in the form and enter flpnwc-xxxxxxx in the SAP Cloud Platform subaccount details.You should now get a new tile. Hit the edit icon to go to the admin space and configure the site to your likings, like you would normally do in the NEO environment.Now, when you want to create an app tile, which path should you use? You cannot simply select an existing HTML5 app from the repository like you would normally do.Right now, you can choose the path, we will configure the destination later: Component-URL: /frontend-yourapp.Now, we need to do a couple of things before we can deploy the site.Configure the site for CloudFoundryGo to services and tools &gt; Implementation pack and download the xs-app.json file and mtad.yaml file.The xs-app.json contains the url regex that needs to be captured, it could look something like this:{\"routes\":[{\"localDir\":\"themes\",\"source\":\"/themes/(.*)\",    \"cacheControl\":\"public, max-age=31536000,must-revalidate\",\"target\":\"$1\"},       {\"source\":\"^/sci/(.*)\",\"target\":\"$1\",\"destination\":\"sci\"},    {\"source\":\"^/frontend-yourapp/(.*)\",\"target\":\"$1\",\"destination\":\"frontend-yourapp\"},This file tells the Portal to redirect urls starting with /sci to point to destination SCI.In my case this points to my backend, using SAP Cloud Integration, you can use any name but I have only tried this with internet reachable systems. I still need to try this with on-premise systems that have to be accessed over the SAP Cloud Connector.The second entry tells urls starting with /frontend-yourapp to point to a destination with the same name. Note that I have used this url as the component url of my SAPUI5 app in the Portal admin space.When finished upload the file using the button in the implemenation pack.Next, open the mtad.yaml file. This one is a little bit more complex…It could look like this:_schema-version: '2.0'ID: portal-site-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxversion: 1.2.0modules:  - name: site-entry-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx    type: javascript.nodejs    path: site-entry/    parameters:      memory: 256M    requires:      - name: site-host-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx0      - name: portal-uaa      - name: reels-approuter        group: destinations        properties:          name: approuter          url: ~{url}          forwardAuthToken: true      - name: demo-sci        group: destinations        properties:          name: sci          url: ~{url}          forwardAuthToken: true      - name: demo-frontend-yourapp        group: destinations        properties:          name: frontend-yourapp          url: ~{url}          forwardAuthToken: true      - name: sapui5-provider        properties:          sapui5url: '~{url}'        - name: site-content-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx    type: com.sap.portal.site-content    path: site-content/    parameters:      health-check-type: none      memory: 128M    requires:      - name: site-client-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx      - name: portal-uaaresources:  - name: site-host-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service    parameters:      service: portal-services      service-plan: site-host      config:        siteId: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  - name: portal-uaa    type: org.cloudfoundry.existing-service    parameters:      service-name: \"my-xsuaa\"  - name: sapui5-provider    properties:      url: 'https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com'  - name: site-client-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service    parameters:      service: portal-services      service-plan: site-content      config:        siteId: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx   - name: demo-sci    properties:       url: https://mysubdomain.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/api/  - name: demo-frontend-yourapp    properties:       url: https://yourapp-somesubdomain.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/You can see the mapping of the destinations named before to the right urls. I have two destinations here, one for my backend connection and one for the frontend. The frontend url is the one we wrote down earlier when deploying the SAPUI5 app.For the portal to work you also need a XSUAA service instance to bind to. If you don’t already have one, this is the time to create an insance.If all of this is done, upload the mtad.yaml file as well. Then, hit the ‘Download’ button below. Go back to your Portal dashboard in the CloudFoundry space. Click the ‘deploy portal site’ icon on the tile of your portal. Upload the mtar file you just downloaded and let the platform do its work.Check datasource url in the appA last point of attention would be the datasource in the SAPUI5 app. Make sure the datasource matched the url we configured in the destinations of the portal. Redeploy your SAPUI5 app if required.Also, in my experience, the Portal acts as the AppRouter would act. So when using url’s pointing to location behind an AppRouter, it won’t work."
